- This guide will help you set up a backend application in Node.js using npm (Node Package Manager).
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- Npm is a package manager for Node.js that helps you manage dependencies and libraries for your application.

# Prerequisites
- Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
  - Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
  - npm: npm is bundled with Node.js, so once you have Node.js installed, you will automatically have npm.

# Project Setup

1. Clone the repo using the command:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/muiruri-associates/muiaa-backend.git
```

2. After cloning the project change to that directory

```sh
  cd muiaa-backend
```

3. Run the following command to install all the dependencies

```sh
  npm install
```

4. After installing all the dependencies, create a folder .env and copy all the content inside the env.config to .env file
5. To run this app locally in development mode use the below command:

```sh
  npm start
```

This command will start the server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.
